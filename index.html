      This meant you knew a lot of the people in the schools, yet year after year, you never had a consistent friend group. 
      Finally, in your high school, you think you finally fit in with a group of friends. They were the friendly people you met in middle school, but never really talked to until high school. 
      You do everything with them, and are so happy that you finally belong. You are living what you thought was a good life. 
      You are doing the things you like to do as well as being with the people you love around you.

      One day, as you were being dropped off at school, your dad tells you that he got a job opportunity. He was being offered a job in New York. He tells you that New York was going to give our family such a big opportunity. 
      It is a big state, after all, you’ve seen movies and shows, New York had everything. Plus, you always wanted to go to New York. It was a dream of yours ever since you went to visit New York that one week. 
      You wanted to go out and see the world. Be a city gal walking along the tall buildings with your heels. A city gal calling a cab in order to get to her destination. A city girl living our her own free life.
